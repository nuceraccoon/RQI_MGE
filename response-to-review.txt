Response to reviewer comments

-Section II.C, last paragraph on page 12: "When using multiple energy sets, cross-set communication is prohibited by having… "
is confusing.  Specifically, this statement

"In the case of an unequal number of groups per set, all sets are forced to have the same grid depth to enforce energy load balancing between sets."
appears to contradict the rest of the paragraph.  Are all sets forced to use the same grid depth, or is the grid depth determined
by the set with the minimum number of groups?


Wording was changed to clarify what is going on with the number of groups per set when energy sets are used as well as how that affects communication.


- II.C first paragraph: What is meant by any reduction in iteration counter will have a significant benefit in terms of cost per iteration?

Wording what changed to more clearly state why iterations become more expensive with each additional iteration. 



- Table 2: why is the non-preconditioned PI keff significantly different with smaller errors than the RQI w1r2v2 case?  It appears
different convergence criteria are being used and significantly different keffs have been calculated.

Added explicitly what the convergence criteria were
Removed a line of table II that wasn’t contributing
Updated the error terms to newer and/or correct values (some were incorrect)

Now it is clearer that the PI and RQI values are close to one another compared to the error. The associated description was also slightly updated for clarity.
